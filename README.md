# _typ_ app ✍️

#### _typ_ is like Instagram for text. It allows you to add some predefined typography styles like "filters" to your posts.

I created this app to practice React JS ⚛️ and learn Redux. My goal was also to adapt some good practices and React design patterns such as separating presentational and container components and following Airbnb React/JSX Style Guide to keep code clean and consistant. I chose Firebase 🔥 as a backend for store data and authentication. For better look app utilizes Typekit fonts.
